# 🤖 Restore Rusty

**Restore Rusty** is a 3D **platformer game** developed in **Unity** as part of the **COMP307** curriculum at the **University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN)**.  
Step into the tiny metal feet of *Rusty*, a forgotten toy robot who awakens in a world that has grown huge around him — and must repair himself piece by piece to come back to life.

## 🌍 Game Overview

Rusty is small. The world is not.  
Explore dusty rooms, towering furniture, and long-forgotten corners of a once-familiar home as you collect parts, repair your systems, and rediscover your purpose.  

Inspired by the charm of *Toy Story* and classic 3D platformers, **Restore Rusty** blends exploration, light physics interaction, and heartwarming storytelling.
